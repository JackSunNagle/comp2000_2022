With the implementation of the actors into their own separate threads, there doesnâ€™t seem to be any thread-safety issues. As a new actor object is created for each new thread, so each thread would not be trying to access the same values. 

With changes introduced for the screen to be re-drawn 50 times in a second, there is a thread-safety issue where the canvas element is being accessed by the main thread and thread-0 (the new thread that re-draws the screen). Because the threads try to access the same element and the time intervals that each thread access the canvas element are not the same, each thread will eventually try to access this element at the same time, causing a thread to not work. (because each thread is running each functions so many times so quickly, the error is unnoticeable when playing the game, and the error is only seen in the terminal). The redraw thread tries to the repaint the canvas the same time that the canvas.stage tries to update, causing thread-0 to fail to repaint in that instance. 

To fix this issue, you would have to synchronize these threads, based on the stage class and its functions. Most likely the update function and the paint function. 

Currently when you synchronize both the paint and update functions within stage, the error seems to be fixed where the thread-0 is now no longer has an error when accessing the stage class.
